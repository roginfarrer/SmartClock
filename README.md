# SmartClock

### A notification-responsive clock widget for iOS

## Installation

SmartClock requires "InfoStats" and "groovyapi." You can find both on Cydia. Then download the SmartClock folder and place it in either `~/var/mobile/Library/Groovylock` or `~/var/mobile/Library/LockHTML`.

## Device Support

SmartClock was designed and tested on an iPhone 6 on iOS 8.4. The widget should work on all devices, but you may have to change the font-size to accommodate different screen sizes and resolutions.

## Thank you

Thank you to the developers of Cataracs, SevenClock, and BotoClock for the inspiration. Google provided the starting place for the [battery icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/).
